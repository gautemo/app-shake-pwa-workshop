# Exercise 2 - Cache files & offline mode

## Cache files

We use [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox) to simplify the caching of files and strategy.

## Offline UI

User should fetch leaderboard if online and display it. If offline the user should get feedback about it.

Check if online with JavaScript on [What Web Can Do Today](https://whatwebcando.today/online-state.html).

If you are done early you can change to show leaderboard if scores are loaded, but is offline afterwards.
